      <p>
        Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant founded by two
        brothers who wanted to share the flavors of their heritage with
        Chicago. Every dish is crafted from traditional recipes with fresh,
        seasonal ingredients sourced locally wherever possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is simple: bring people together over great food in a warm,
        welcoming atmosphere.
